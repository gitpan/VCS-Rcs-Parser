This is VCS::Rcs::Parser Package. 

RCSfile parsing with Parse::Yapp and Rcs 'co' implimentation in Perl.

To install the package as root:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   ( try the tests in the examples/ directory as well )
   # make install

if you do not have privilages to install it system wide: (like me)

   $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/user   (or wherever you can write to)
   $ make
   $ make test
   ( try the tests in the examples/ directory as well )
   $ make install

 The tests are in shell script for now. I know its bad.
 I will put them in test.pl as soon as I can. 

WARNING:
THIS IS A BETA SOFTWARE.
DONT USE IT FOR PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU HAVE DONE THE
TESTS ON THE FILES YOU ARE WORKING WITH.
* 0.04 has a memory leak!!! upgrade

BUGS:

* 'CO' algoritm does not follow branches, or even 'next's. 
  It only follows the order deltatext is written to the ,v 
  revision file.

* Probably more!


TESTS:

* There is a examples/test.sh script fro comparing the results 
  with standart 'co'. Run this to see if it diffs OK.

* If you want to check your ,v revision files, -if it works with your files-
  stick them in the examples/RCS directory, and try form there.

* There is a co.pl script you can use instead of 'co'. Don't forget. It
  is very limited.
